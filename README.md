# KiwisDream
yet another console game

##Arch Mage Team

***

We have emerged from the dark forest called Telerik Software Academy where no one gets out without a scar for life and where your only chance for survival is to say goodbye to your personal life and prepare for a long and tiresome battle.

## Our Inspiration

***

When you think "kiwi" you are probably thinking of a brown skinned fruit with a delicious green interior. Our kiwi is a little different. It is a flightless bird around the size of an average chicken. If you use youtube you have probably watched the sad story of a kiwi whose dream is to fly.
So long story short.. our kiwi is nailing an array of trees to the side of a sheer cliff so that they stick out horizontally. When he’s done he puts on an aviators cap and jumps off the cliff head first. While he’s falling down to him it seems like he’s zooming through a forest. He so longs to be able to fly that he is ready to die to make his dream come true.

## Our Interpretation

***

In our game you can help the kiwi fly longer before he reaches the end of the cliff or before he gets a heart attack. So watch out for the trees, collect lifes, try to slow down the kiwi’s speed and have fun :)
* You can move the kiwi up, down, left and right
* You lose a life a life when you hit a tree
* You gain a life when you collect 1up
* You slow down your speed when you collect a SpdD
